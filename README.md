  * This beloved and market-leading Operations Management book has been completely updated in the 14th edition and provides a clear presentation of the field of Operations Management with current real-world examples and thoughtful student pedagogy. The comprehensive breadth of content is presented in more modular flexible chapters, so it may be used for different course levels ranging from undergrad to executive education. That flexibility allows for the choice of more or less quantitative material and flexibility in order of presentation since chapters do not depend on sequence. The topics covered include both strategic issues and practical applications. Among the topics are forecasting, product and service design, capacity planning, management of quality and quality control, inventory management, scheduling, supply chain management, and project management. The use of an adaptive online learning enhances the student experience and success.
